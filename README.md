Home automation using arduino


My project is a prototype for home automation, where you can control the remote home devices using your phone from anywhere inside your home.
Components used for hardware

1.Node mcu(ESP8266) 
2.DC motor
3.3 channel 5V relay
4.Motor driver
5.Bulb
6.Fan
7.A door lock

My project is simply controlling a door lock,a bulb and a fan from a local host.
Yu can access the local host by connecting a hotspot to the nodemcu wifi, and typing your local ip in the address bar.
Then the controller is simply yours.
